A minimalistic game loader for Old School RuneScape.

## Features
- Super portable. One ~80 kB file is all you need. Ideal for people who use
  multiple computers.
- Cross-platform support. Should run on any platform that supports Java with
  Swing.
  - Tested on *Windows 10*, and *Ubuntu 17.04*.
- Gamepack caching and automatic updating. This ensures quick loading times,
  as the game client is only downloaded when a new version comes out.
- Built-in screenshot ability.
